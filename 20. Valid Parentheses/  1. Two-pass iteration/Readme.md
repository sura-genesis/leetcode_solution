#two-pass iteration 

iteration is a sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved.
in this two pass Iteration we have to repeating the process of iterating throuth the string twice in two different steps.

  # first pass
    iterate through the string and count the occurrences of each type of opening and closing parenthesis.
  # second pass
     maintain a counter for the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses encountered so far.
